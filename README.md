# Flashi:

A study app with flashcards



## Getting Started

This is a Flutter application. Follow this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly0hAtV7EBg) to run the project on your computer.

    ### How To Use Flashi:
    - Simply tap on ‘Study’ and choose your subject and topic. Example: ...Study-->Science-->Biology…
    - Enjoy an easy to use scroll wheel with all the pre made Flashi flashcards in that topic
    - You can also create your own custom flashcards by tapping on ‘Create’ from the homescreen

### Current Bugs:
- background colors revert when entering text on create page
- drawer doesn't close when tapped outside
- navigating to the settings page from the flashcard screen or create screen throws an error
